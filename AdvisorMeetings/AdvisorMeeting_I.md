## Advisor Notes

Think about the small scale vs large scale of your project - you can impact and
influence different audiences depending on the scale you work at - do you want to
do both?
Existing city or fully imaginary city - consider maybe working from something
existing, that may be an easier starting point for you.

***Action Plan for Next Steps What should the student aim to achieve before the next tutorial?***
• Decide on your target audiences, ie.
o Is it tool design for urban designers? or is it communicating your
concept through data and experiential design to show this future
possible world? (There is a way for them to potentially overlap, but
choosing one to start with will help you to have a clear direction)
• Have a go at writing a rough research question.
• Work on updating your timetable as your idea solidifies.
• Do some reading around methods and methodology, just to familiarize
yourself
